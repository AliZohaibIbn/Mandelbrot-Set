# Mandelbrot-Set
A Simple representation of mandelbrot set

Basically, this is a simple graphical representation of mandelbrot set in C++. You can compile it with sfml and run it. Then you can do both zooming and panning.
Not very interesting but it clearly demonstrates the power of iterations and complex numbers.
